### Registration Guide for Vietnamese High School Graduation Exam 2022 (for foreign examinee or who are curious about Vietnamese HSGE) ###

### Do it with caution and there are some reminder for you before registration! ###


### Disclaimer ###
+ I won't take responsible if:

- You don't read these carefully, and you could be kicked out of your school . 

+ BE CAUTIOUS:

(!) IELTS/TOEFL cerf upload feature isn't available (temporarily) so just skip it and upload the cerf when the feature is available. Now, just choose the cert and write your score
If your certificate is at JPG/JPEG format (image) then go to this site and convert it to PDF (Wait until Ministry of Education & Training enables the upload feature, then you can upload it)

https://smallpdf.com/jpg-to-pdf

(cert = certificate = bằng cấp)

(!) HTTPS protocol when, Ministry of Education & Training?

(!) This could be a bit different than the guide that your school provided, but it will be nearly the same with that guide.
